# Envoice

## Overview

Envoice is a full stack Invoice app made using MERN Stack. This was my first time doing anything full stack so that was my motivation. I learned how to pass data to and from a database which i thought was more complicated than it was. If i had more time with this project, I would have implemented jobs from an API instead of making fake ones, and perhaps added a way to track your applications
